		<p>You requested a page that is either not available on my site or you mistyped the URL. Here is what you can do, depending on the situation:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><p>If you were looking for the 404 page of my site on purpose, then congratulations, you found it! You can go back now.</p></li>

			<li><p>If you found this page unintentionally, first try checking and retyping the URL. If it still results in a 404, try rewriting the URL three more times, just to make sure. Finally, if you've given up hope and can't access the page you are looking for, <a href='https://twitter.com/hagretek'>write me a DM on Twitter</a>.
