		<p>You requested a page that is either not available on my site or you mistyped the URL. Here is what you can do, depending on what you were trying to accomplish:</p>

		<ul style="padding: 0 2%;">
			<li><p>If you were looking for the 404 page of my site on purpose (why, exactly?), then congratulations, you found it! You can go back now.</p></li>

			<li><p>If you found this page unintentionally, first try checking and retyping the URL. If it still results in a 404, I dunno, try doing it again like three more times, just to be sure. Finally, if you've given up all hope and can't access the page you are looking for and are absolutely sure it exists, <a href="https://github.com/HagRetek/hagretek.github.io/issues">here's the Github repo of the page</a>, for submitting an issue. Or, <a href="https://twitter.com/hagretek">write me a DM on Twitter</a>.</p></li>
		</ul>
